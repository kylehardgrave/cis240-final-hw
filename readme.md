# CIS 240 Final Homework #

## shopper ##
Everything in shopper is pretty straightforward. `shopper.c` handles the main parsing logic, while `linkedlist.c` handles, obviously, the implementation of the linked list. DRY was favored over efficiency, though the implementation isn't is O(1) where you'd expect it (i.e., adding a list element).

**NB**: I chose failing noisily over being useful -- thus, an incorrectly formatted line will cause the program to fail.
